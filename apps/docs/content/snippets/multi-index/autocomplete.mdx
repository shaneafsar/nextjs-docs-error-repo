## Build a multi-source autocomplete experience

  **One of the most common use cases of multi-index search is when you're building an autocomplete experience.** For example, you may want to display Query Suggestions together with recent searches, create a multi-column layout mixing facets and item previews, or even dynamically change sources based on the query.

  You can use the [Autocomplete library](/doc/ui-libraries/autocomplete/introduction/what-is-autocomplete/) in your InstantSearch app to build a dynamic multi-source autocomplete experience. Autocomplete isn't limited to Algolia indices, so you can even use static sources or fetch data from other APIs.
