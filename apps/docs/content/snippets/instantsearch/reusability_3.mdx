#### Targeting a record attribute

  When a widget needs to target a specific record attribute, you should expose an `attribute` option in the connector. This is the case for most refinement widgets like <Var type="link" link={{url:"/ui-libraries/instantsearch/refinements/color-refinement-list/$lang", text: "refinement-list"}}/> so you can select the specific attribute to refine.

  The `attribute` option typically accepts a string. For deeply nested objects, you can accept dot-separated values like `"brand.name"` or an array of strings like `["brand", "name"]`.

  #### Including or excluding attributes

  When a widget manipulates selected refinements, you may want to let users select what attributes to include or exclude. This is the case with widgets like <Var type="link" link={{url:"/ui-libraries/instantsearch/refinements/current-refinements/$lang", text: "current-refinements"}}/> %> or <Var type="link" link={{url:"/ui-libraries/instantsearch/refinements/clear-refinements/$lang", text: "clear-refinement"}}/> so you can hand-pick exactly what attributes to manipulate.

  #### Limiting items

  When a widget manipulates items, notably facet refinements, you may want to let users limit how many of them to retrieve. Widgets like <Var type="link" link={{url:"/ui-libraries/instantsearch/refinements/color-refinement-list/$lang", text: "refinement-list"}}/> or <Var type="link" link={{url:"/ui-libraries/instantsearch/refinements/menu/$lang", text: "menu"}}/> expose a `limit` option, which is directly forwarded to the Algolia search engine with the <Var type="link" link={{url:"/api-reference/api-parameters/$lang", text: "maxValuesPerFacet"}}/> search parameter.

  Such widgets usually expose two extra options to let end users toggle more facets: `showMore`, a boolean option to enable the feature, and `showMoreLimit`, to define the maximum number of items to display if the widget is showing more items.

  #### Transforming items

  When a widget manipulates items like hits or facets, users may want to change them before rendering. To do so, you should expose a `transformItems` option for transforming, removing, or reordering items on the connector.

  The `transformItems` option is a function that receives the items and should return a new array of the same shape. The default value is an identity function.
