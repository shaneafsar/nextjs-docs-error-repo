## Making the widget reusable

  You might want to reuse your widget within your app, share it across multiple projects, or even publish it on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for others to enjoy. To do so, **you can provide APIs to allow customization** while abstracting the complexity away.

  InstantSearch exposes consistent APIs. You can follow the same guidelines and conventions in your own widgets and connectors.
