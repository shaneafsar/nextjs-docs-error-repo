Using the dashboard, you can either import a file or connect Algolia to a file on your servers:

- **File importing** can be helpful when you're just starting with Algolia and want to test it with sample data. However, you can't use the dashboard to update _existing_ data (to synchronize or update such data, use an [API client](/api-client/getting-started/install/php/)).
- **The no-code connector.**  If you [provide a URL that links to a data file](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/how-to/importing-with-no-code-connectors/), Algolia will fetch and process that data. The engine will synchronize changes to the file's contents and update its indices accordingly.
## File importing

Algolia uses [JSON to model records](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/what-is-in-a-record/) and can import JSON, CSV, and TSV files:

```json
[
  {
    "firstname": "Jimmie",
    "lastname": "Barninger"
  },
  {
    "firstname": "Warren",
    "lastname": "Speach"
  }
]
```

```csv
firstname,lastname
Jimmie,Barninger
Warren,Speach
```

```tsv
"firstname" "lastname"
"Jimmie"    "Barninger"
"Warren"    "Speach"
```

## Creating a new index

To create a new index to import your file data into:

1. Go to the [**Indices** tab](https://dashboard.algolia.com/explorer/browse) in the Algolia dashboard and click **New > Index**.

1. Give your index a name and click **Create**.

## Uploading the file

To add records to a new index, click **Upload records > Upload file** to import your file.

To add records to an existing index:

1. Click **Add records > Upload file**.
  <Media type="image" id="guides/indexing/upload-json-file-to-dashboard-2.jpg" alt="" />
1. Drop the file into the **Upload records** box or select it on your file system. Then, click **Upload**.

1. Once Algolia has indexed your data, the dashboard will notify you of a successful save.
