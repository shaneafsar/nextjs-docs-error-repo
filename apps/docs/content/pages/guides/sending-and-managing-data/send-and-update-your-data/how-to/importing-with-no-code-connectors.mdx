Algolia's no-code connectors allow you to send your data to Algolia without writing any code. To use a connector, define a data source, an Algolia destination, and a method for transferring data between them. To explore all the available connectors, visit the [**Connectors**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors) page in the Algolia dashboard.

Setting up a connector follows a similar process:

1. Configure your data source
2. Configure your destination (where you want the data to go)
3. Configure your task (determine how you want that data transferred).
 
The process detailed below for the JSON connector is an example of how to set up one of these connectors.

## Configure your data source

1. Visit the [**Connectors** page](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors) to view the available options.
2. Click the **Connect** button for the JSON connector. Then select **Get started**.
3. Choose the appropriate authentication method based on your JSON file. The connector supports publicly available files and those protected with a username and password.
4. Enter the FTP or HTTP URL for your JSON file. If your file is hosted on HTTP, select the appropriate HTTP method.
5. Enter the name of the property that serves as a unique identifier for each record. This property is set as the `objectID` in Algolia.
6. Enter a name to identify this data source. This name should be easily recognizable and human-readable to aid its reuse in other areas of the connector platform.
7. Click **Create source** to create a new data source and move to the next step.

## Configure your destination

The JSON connector supports sending data to an index.

1. Create or select an [Algolia API key](/guides/security/api-keys/) to use with your index.
2. Select an existing index or enter a name to create a new one.
3. Enter a name to identify this destination. This name should be easily recognizable and human-readable to aid its reuse in other areas of the connector platform.
4. Click **Create destination** to create a new destination and move to the final step.

## Configure your task



1. Decide if you want your data fetched on a schedule or only on demand.
2. If on a schedule, select an option from the drop-down menu's list of popular schedules or enter a cron expression.
3. Click **Create task** to create a new task.

### Manage your task

After you've completed the preceding steps, the Tasks page will display the status of your task and allow you to manage it. From this page, you can allow the task to run, prevent it from running, delete it, or run it on demand.

<Callout type="info">
  A task will be automatically deactivated if it fails more than 5 times in a row, with a `critical` outcome reason. You can monitor runs in the [Connector Debugger](https://algolia.com/connectors/debugger).
</Callout>

## Connector specifications and requirements

### JSON connector

The JSON connector expects a single array of JSON objects to be imported as records. Each record must have a unique identifier to be used as the [Object ID](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#unique-object-identifiers) in Algolia.

In this example, `userID` should be used as the unique identifier.

```json
[
  {
    "userID": 1001,
    "firstName": "Marianne",
    "lastName": "Neal"
  },
  {
    "userID": 1002,
    "firstName": "Austin",
    "lastName": "Wolfe"
  }
]
```

### CSV connector

The CSV connector expects a comma-separated values file where each row represents a record. Each row must have a unique identifier that Algolia uses as the [Object ID](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#unique-object-identifiers).

```csv
userID,firstName,lastName
1001,Marianne,Neal
1002,Austin,Wolfe
```

### Google BigQuery connector

To use Algolia's Google BigQuery connector, you must have a [Google service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) with the following permissions for the table you want to connect to:

```
bigquery.datasets.get
bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy
bigquery.jobs.create
bigquery.models.export
bigquery.models.getData
bigquery.models.getMetadata
bigquery.models.list
bigquery.routines.get
bigquery.routines.list
bigquery.tables.createSnapshot
bigquery.tables.export
bigquery.tables.get
bigquery.tables.getData
bigquery.tables.getIamPolicy
bigquery.tables.list
resourcemanager.projects.get
```

The connector will import your selected table by default. If you want to use a custom SQL statement to change the imported data, replace your table name with %s,  for example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM %s WHERE Status="Available"
```

Each row in your table must have a unique identifier. Algolia uses this as the [Object ID](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#unique-object-identifiers).

<Callout type="info">
  To ensure you don't exceed your BigQuery quota, don't schedule data extracts to run more frequently than once a day.
</Callout>

## Authentication

Protected data sources and destinations can also include authentication credentials.
This information can be stored as a reusable object and used with multiple data sources and destinations.
For example, the JSON connector can connect to files protected by a username and password.

Your Algolia index requires an API key for ingesting data
and ensuring this API key has the correct scopes is essential.
For the no-code connectors, the API should have the following permissions: `addObject`, `deleteIndex`, and `editSettings`.

You can find and manage your credentials on the **Authentications** tab in the [**Connectors**](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors) page of the Algolia dashboard.
