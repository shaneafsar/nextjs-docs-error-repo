**All indexing operations are asynchronous.** When calling indexing methods or endpoints, you're adding a new job to a queue: it's this job, and not the API method, that performs the desired action.

A job usually finishes within seconds, if not milliseconds. Yet, it all depends on what's in the queue. **When the queue has many pending tasks, the new job needs to wait its turn**.

## When to wait for tasks

To help manage asynchronous jobs, each method returns a unique `taskId` which you can use with the [`waitTask`](/api-reference/api-methods/waitTask) method. Using this method guarantees that a job has finished before proceeding with a new request. There are a few situations when this comes in handy:

- **Managing dependencies**: you want to use [`waitTask`](/api-reference/api-methods/waitTask) to manage dependencies, for example, when deleting an index before creating a new index with the same name or clearing an index before adding new objects.
- **Atomic reindexing**: atomic reindexing is a way to update all your records without any downtime, by populating a temporary index and replacing the destination index with it. **You don't need to implement this by yourself.** Instead, you can use the [`replaceAllObjects`](/api-reference/api-methods/replaceAllObjects) method which does it all for you.
- **Frontend events**: if you're building a frontend interface that performs indexing operations, you may want to react to completed tasks. For example, you may want to display a success message when an indexing operation has completed, or refresh a page, or move on with some following, co-dependant operations, etc.
- **Debugging**: You also most often need [`waitTask`](/api-reference/api-methods/waitTask) in debugging scenarios, when you're testing a search immediately after updating an index.

## When not to wait for tasks

**In most scenarios, you don't need to wait for tasks to complete before moving on with new ones.** Using [`waitTask`](/api-reference/api-methods/waitTask) makes your indexing operations synchronous, thus slows them down.

Conversely, you don't need to use [`waitTask`](/api-reference/api-methods/waitTask) in place of the asynchronous mechanisms of your programming language. You can ensure that tasks are queued in order by using promises or callbacks.
