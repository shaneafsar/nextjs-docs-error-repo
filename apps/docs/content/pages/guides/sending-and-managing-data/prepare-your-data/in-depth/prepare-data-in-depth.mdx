Before sending anything to Algolia, consider where your data lives and **what information you want to make searchable**. For a retail outlet, it's products. For a music store, it's records and artists. For a real estate company, it's houses and locations.

The next question is, **"What information do you need to build a search experience?"** You don't need everything: just what's necessary.

## Fetching data

To get started, extract your data and send it to Algolia's servers. The data may come from a relational database, XML files, or Excel spreadsheets. The original data format doesn't matter. You just need **a way to fetch and transform your data into a format that Algolia understands**.

You likely want to write a script to fetch, transform, and [send your data to Algolia](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/).

For example, you have a custom PHP blog with a MySQL database and want to make your blog posts searchable. You can create a script that fetches the posts from your database, transforms the data, and rearranges it into records. Then, use the [PHP API client](/api-client/getting-started/what-is-the-api-client/php/) to send the objects to Algolia and keep the data up to date when you add, update, or delete a post.

## Structuring records

When adding data to your records, be selective. For example, if you're working with a product line, you don't need to send every piece of information about your products: only what serves the purposes of search. Include all the necessary information to find products, rank them, and display them on your website or app.

Building records involves:

- Extracting valuable data
- Reworking the data to remove unnecessary elements
- Adding or computing extra information that improves the chances of finding the most relevant results.

### Reworking and formatting data

Imagine you want to create a search experience around movies, which means users may want to search and display movie titles, synopses, and cast. You also want to display (but not search) images and country of release, filter on genre or a range of dates, and rank based on review scores. However, you don't care about technical information, such as how long the movie is.

Given your data comes from a relational database, with the information you need in different tables, you need to query the data from these tables. After fetching it, a record for one movie may look like the following:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Spirited Away",
    "synopsis": "During her family's move to the suburbs, a sullen 10-year-old girl wanders into a world ruled by gods, witches, and spirits, and where humans are changed into beasts.",
    "director": "Hayao Miyazaki",
    "cast": [
      {
        "name": "Rumi Hiiragi",
        "birth_date": "August 1, 1987",
        "birth_place": "Tokyo, Japan"
      },
      {
        "name": "Miyu Irino",
        "birth_date": "February 19, 1988",
        "birth_place": "Tokyo, Japan"
      },
      {
        "name": "Mari Natsuki",
        "birth_date": "May 2, 1952",
        "birth_place": "Tokyo, Japan"
      }
    ],
    "release_year": 2001,
    "country": "Japan",
    "genres": [
      "Animation",
      "Adventure",
      "Family",
      "Fantasy",
      "Mystery"
    ],
    "runtime": 125,
    "aspect_ratio": "1.85:1",
    "content_rating": "PG",
    "review_scores": {
      "imdb": 8.6,
      "rotten_tomatoes": {
        "critics": 97,
        "audience": 96
      }
    },
    "images": [
      "https://example.com/spirited-away/image1.jpg",
      "https://example.com/spirited-away/image2.jpg"
    ]
  }
]
```

The example contains several kinds of content, some useful for a search experience, some that aren't, and others that require reformatting. For example, you don't need to keep `runtime` or `aspect_ratio`. While they're helpful in other contexts, they have little value when searching, filtering, ranking, or displaying search results.

While the names of the voice actors in the `cast` attribute are helpful, you don't need their birth date and place. Therefore, you can safely remove them and just keep the names. **This process [removes noise and saves room in records](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/reducing-object-size/) for more valuable data.**

```json
{
  "cast": [
    "Rumi Hiiragi",
    "Miyu Irino",
    "Mari Natsuki"
  ]
}
```

#### Data for searching

Attributes for searching are the ones that contain the terms that your users look for. If you want to search for a movie by title, plot, genre, or cast, you need attributes that contain these terms. In the example, such attributes are `title`, `synopsis`, `director`, `cast`, and `genres`.

Algolia lets you define in which specific attributes to search, using the [`searchableAttributes`](/api-reference/api-parameters/searchableAttributes) parameter. By default, the engine searches within the entire record, but you want to adjust this: this is better for performance and allows you to remove noise. Don't search attributes that aren't textually relevant or might generate _false positives_, like `images`, `release_year`, `review_scores`, or `country`. For example, when searching for "japan", users most likely want to find movies that either have the term in the title or take place in Japan rather than Japanese movies.

You can therefore set `title`, `synopsis`, `director`, `cast`, and `genres` as [`searchableAttributes`](/api-reference/api-parameters/searchableAttributes) and **leave out the rest for displaying, filtering, and custom ranking**.

You can add extra data to improve the discoverability of your record. For example, some users may look for a movie by its original title or translation in their language. Unless the translations are in the record, searching for these terms would return no results, so it's a good idea to retrieve them and add them to your objects. You can fetch them from your database if you have them or a third-party source such as an API or a website.

```json
{
  "display_title": "Spirited Away",
  "original_title": "千と千尋の神隠し",
  "alternative_title": [
    "Le voyage de Chihiro",
    "El viaje de Chihiro",
    "Chihiros Reise ins Zauberland"
  ]
}
```

#### Data for filtering and faceting

When you have a large amount of data, you should improve your user's search experience by letting them fine-tune their query by filtering it.

For example, they may want to find all movies by director Hayao Miyazaki, find new adventure movies to watch, or look for the best motion pictures of the past year.



Algolia lets you filter results based on attributes. In this case, you could use `director`, `cast`, `country`, `content_rating`, and `genres` and display them as refinement lists in your search experience, _and_ `release_year` to display a range slider. Declare them with the [`attributesForFaceting`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesForFaceting) parameter.

Filterable attributes can be anything, but you should _normalize_ your data to ensure consistency. For example, if you have attribute `genres` with the term "Animation" in one record and "Animated picture" in another, these would result in two different facet values.

<div className="panel">
{/* Partial: panel/table.haml */}
</div>

#### Custom ranking

Algolia ensures that the most textually relevant results come first, but there might be ties in terms of relevance.



For example, if a user looks for "james bond", all James Bond movies would match equally.



Without anything else to break the tie, Algolia falls back on the `objectID` in alphanumeric order, which isn't helpful. A better way to break ties is to compare _meaningful_ information. For movies, it can be review scores or likes. For a retail store, it could be the number of sales.

Algolia lets you inject business metrics to influence the ranking formula with the [`customRanking`](/api-reference/api-parameters/customRanking) parameter. Attributes for custom ranking can be either numeric or boolean.

In this case, use the `review_scores` attribute. However, since you have several scores, you may want to compute them into a global one and use them in custom ranking. The computed attribute would look like this:

```json
{
  "computed_score": 201.6
}
```

Depending on whether you plan to display the individual scores in the search results, you may keep the original `review_scores` or eliminate them to simplify your records further.

<div className="panel">
{/* Partial: panel/table.haml */}
</div>

#### Handling record hierarchy

Simplifying and restructuring your records doesn't mean losing hierarchy or relationships. For example, if you want your users to search for movies and see them organized by director, you need to store this relationship in your index. Algolia doesn't impose a data schema: you can organize your data in any way you want and keep it straightforward without losing complexity.

The following record represents a director and all the movies they directed (one or several objects). However, it doesn't help users search for individual movies. While you wouldn't want to repeat data in a traditional database, this is perfectly okay in your Algolia index.

```json
{
  "director": "Hayao Miyazaki",
  "movies": [
    {
      "title": "Spirited Away",
      "score": 201.6
    },
    {
      "title": "My Neighbor Totoro",
      "score": 196
    },
    {
      "title": "Princess Mononoke",
      "score": 195.4
    }
  ]
}
```

Now take a look at that same information in three flatter, less hierarchical records:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Spirited Away",
    "score": 201.6,
    "director": "Hayao Miyazaki"
  },
  {
    "title": "My Neighbor Totoro",
    "score": 196,
    "director": "Hayao Miyazaki"
  },
  {
    "title": "Princess Mononoke",
    "score": 195.4,
    "director": "Hayao Miyazaki"
  }
]
```

This format lets you find movies more easily. Additionally, if you wanted to show a limited number of movies per director, like the most popular ones, you could use Algolia's [`distinct`](/api-reference/api-parameters/distinct) feature on `director` along with custom ranking on `score`. This way, searching for "miyazaki" would only return Hayao Miyazaki's most popular movie.

Flattening data adds more records to your index. If you have 10,000 directors with an average of ten movies each, this results in an index with 100,000 records. It may sound like a lot, but it's not. Besides what your [plan](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/) allows, Algolia has no prescribed limit to the number of records, only [disk size](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/index-and-records-size-and-usage-limitations/).

## Structuring indices

An index is a collection of records. When you perform a search, you look into the records of an Algolia index.

In relational databases, you distribute data across different tables. You break information into small, meaningful units to avoid redundancy. With Algolia, these principles don't matter. As seen earlier, with record structure and data hierarchy, flattened data is best for searching. This applies at the index level too. It's a good approach to create several indices and map them to your tables, where each index represents a different kind of entity. For example, you may want to separate movies from actors and create an index for each. However, this might not serve the purposes of your search. What if you want your users to search for both movies and actors simultaneously and for them to appear in the same results? In that case, a single index works better.

The main reason for this is relevance. Algolia searches one index at a time: it doesn't perform cross-index searches. Searching two indices produces two sets of results, each with a dedicated relevance configuration. Algolia doesn't merge these results, and trying to do this yourself would break the relevance (since combining Algolia's results after a search requires understanding and re-implementing Algolia's ranking algorithm). You would be undoing all the work that Algolia does for you.

It doesn't mean that there are no reasons for having multiple indices but splitting data per entity isn't one of them.

### When to use multiple indices

Your user interface needs usually determine [whether to use one or more indices](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/concepts/one-or-more-indices/). For example, if you want your search experience to display movies and actors separately, it's better to use different indices.

Use separate indices when:

- Showcasing popular queries with Algolia's [Query Suggestions](/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/query-suggestions/js/) feature. You need two indices: one for your content and one for common queries.
- You want to let users switch between rankings, such as ascending or descending popularity. While you can't dynamically change the ranking of an index, you can use [replica indices](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/how-to/creating-replicas/) with the same data and different ranking strategies.

## Custom ranking

High on the list of relevance tuning is [custom ranking](/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking/). When two records rank the same based on textual relevance, you want to tie break based on meaningful metrics, such as popularity, number of views, or sales. Including business metrics in your records is crucial to creating a relevant search experience.

It's a good idea to start thinking about such metrics when fetching your data and structuring your records.

<div className="panel">
{/* Partial: panel/table.haml */}
</div>

### Filters and facets

Including attributes for [filtering](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/) and faceting helps with relevance because it helps users refine their search and narrow down results. As well as using the categories from your data, you can reuse your searchable or ranking data to create new filters and facets. Going back to the movie example, you can use numeric attributes like `year` to display a range filter on the frontend or string attributes like `country` to refine movies nationally.

A good rule of thumb is to **add attributes based on howusers want to fine-tune their search**. If you're selling movies online, useful categories include distribution systems (such as DVD, Blu-Ray, Video on Demand) or content rating (such as PG, PG-13). If you have a movie reviews website, users likely want to refine on review score or popularity.

### Advanced data formatting

Algolia provides a vast collection of settings to help with relevance, and many of these work in combination with how you format your content. For example, whether to use one or several attributes for a single piece of information, including long or short descriptions (or both), repeat the same words in the title and description and how to use custom ranking attributes.
