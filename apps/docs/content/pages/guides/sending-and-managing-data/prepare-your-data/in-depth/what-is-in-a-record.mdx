Algolia uses [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) to model records.

Here's an example of a typical record:

```json
[
  {
    "objectID": 42,
    "title": "Breaking Bad",
    "episodes": [
      "Crazy Handful of Nothin'",
      "Gray Matter"
    ],
    "like_count": 978,
    "avg_rating": 1.23456,
    "air_date": 1356846157,
    "featured": true,
    "lead_role": {
      "name": "Walter White",
      "portrayed_by": "Bryan Cranston"
    },
    "_tags": ["tv series", "drugs"]
  }
]
```

Your records can have attributes with the following formats:

- string: `"title": "Breaking Bad"`
- integer: `"like_count": 978`
- float: `"avg_rating": 1.23456`
- boolean: `"featured": true`
- objects: `"lead_role": { "name": "Walter White", "portrayed_by": "Bryan Cranston" }`
- arrays: `"episodes": ["Crazy Handful of Nothin'", "Gray Matter"]`

<Callout type="info">
  Integers and booleans are treated as strings by [searchable attributes](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/setting-searchable-attributes/) but treated as numerical values by [numerical facets](/api-reference/api-parameters/numericFilters/).
</Callout>

## Unique record identifier

The engine identifies each object with a unique `objectID` attribute.

**You should set `objectID`s yourself**, based on _your_ data. Since you use `objectID`s to update and delete specific records, it's easier if you've defined them yourself. If you don't set `objectID`s, Algolia generates them for you: you can check their values by browsing the index. 

When you retrieve objects, `objectID`s are in string format, even if you set them as integers. If you want to use integers in your application, convert `objectID` into integers after retrieving the objects but make sure that _all_ your `objectID`s contain integer values.

Since `objectID` uniquely identifies your objects:

- **You can search for it** by declaring it as a [`searchableAttributes`](/api-reference/api-parameters/searchableAttributes).
- **You can't highlight or snippet it.** If you declare `objectID` in [`attributesToHighlight`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesToHighlight) or [`attributesToSnippet`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesToSnippet), the engine ignores it.
- **You can't exclude it from results.** If you declare `objectID` in [`unretrievableAttributes`](/api-reference/api-parameters/unretrievableAttributes) or omit it from [`attributesToRetrieve`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesToRetrieve), the engine still returns it. For this reason, `objectID`s mustn't contain any sensitive data.
- **You can use it as a facet filter, but you can't facet it**. If you declare `objectID` in [`attributesForFaceting`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesForFaceting), the engine ignores it. [Faceting on a unique identifier](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/#faceting-on-objectid) makes little sense since every facet count would equal one.

### Acceptable characters for `objectID`s

`objectID` strings can:

- Contain any character
- Be of any length as long as it fits [the size limit for your plan](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406981897617-Is-there-a-size-limit-for-my-index-records-/).

## Dates

If you want to filter or sort by date, you must format date attributes as [Unix timestamps](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) (for example, `1435735848`). Since Algolia's engine doesn't interpret dates as ISO 8601 strings, you must convert them into numeric timestamp values, using the appropriate functions for your chosen programming language:

- Android - [`Date()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Date#Date())
- Go - [`time.Unix`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Unix)
- Java/Scala (java.time package) - [`getTime()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Date.html#getTime%28%29)
- JavaScript - [`getTime()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime)
- Kotlin - [`kotlinx-datetime`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-datetime#converting-instant-to-and-from-unix-time)
- .Net - [`ToUnixTimeSeconds`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetimeoffset.tounixtimeseconds)
- PHP - [`strtotime`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php) 
- Python - [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html?highlight=datetime#datetime-objects)
- Ruby - [`date.to_time`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-3.1.0/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html#method-i-to_time)
- Swift - [`NSDate(withTimeIntervalSince1970:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdate/1591576-datewithtimeintervalsince1970/)

## Reserved attribute names

Algolia's API uses underscore prefixes to identify reserved attribute names, both in records and the search response.

### In your records

In a record, you can use attribute names like `_tags` or `_geoloc`, but they have an [imposed schema](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/how-to/filter-by-tags/#dataset-example). All other attribute names are schema-agnostic.

Reserved words aren't searchable by default. If you want to search `_tags` or `_geoloc`, you must add them to your [`searchableAttributes`](/api-reference/api-parameters/searchableAttributes).

### In the search response

In the search response, Algolia returns attributes such as `_highlightResult`, `_snippetResult`, `_rankingInfo`, or `_distinctSeqID`. They're reserved Algolia attributes tied to specific features. Make sure not to use any of those in your records to avoid conflicts.
