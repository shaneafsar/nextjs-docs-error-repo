## What are nested attributes? 

Nested attributes are a way of applying sub-categories to your attributes. For instance, instead of having a single searchable attribute `price`, you may set up some sub-categories: `price.net`, `price.gross`, `price.margin` (note the use of 'dot notation' here to separate the parent attribute from its child).

## How to create nested attributes 

You can create nested attributes by adding a JSON object to your records when you [send your records to Algolia](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data). For example:

```json
{
  "title": "Bread",
  "price": {
    "net": 1.99,
    "gross": 1.75
  }
}
```

## Where you can use nested attributes

You can use nested attributes wherever you might use a regular attribute, such as [`searchableAttributes`](/api-reference/api-parameters/searchableAttributes/#usage-notes) and [`attributesForFaceting`](/api-reference/api-parameters/attributesForFaceting/#usage-notes). Just make sure you use the appropriate dot notation (for example, `authors.mainAuthor`) to refer to them.

<Callout type="info">
  You can't add nested attributes to [`searchableAttributes`](/api-reference/api-parameters/searchableAttributes) in the dashboard, you must use the [`setSettings`](/api-reference/api-methods/setSettings) method on an API client to define them.

There are no limitations on the number of nested attributes apart from [the default restrictions on record size](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/index-and-records-size-and-usage-limitations/). There are also no limits on the depth of your nesting: you could use something like `price.net.england.yorkshire`.
