To ensure good performance, Algolia has a maximum limit on record size of . If you exceed this limit, Algolia returns the error message `Record is too big`.

Instead of upgrading your plan, make your records smaller _before_ [sending them to Algolia](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/). Do this by:

- Only sending the necessary information by [removing unused attributes](#remove-unused-attributes)
- [Splitting long documents into smaller parts](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/indexing-long-documents/). 

## Remove unused attributes

**You might not need to index every attribute from your data sources**. For example, if you're developing a website to display tweets on specific topics, Twitter may send you a lot of data, but only some will help when searching. For example, an excerpt of the Twitter API response might look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Good morning #LaraconEU ! Swing by the Algolia booth for some vintage video games, awesome stickers, and lightning-fast search ðŸ˜Ž",
    "truncated": false,
    "in_reply_to_user_id": null,
    "in_reply_to_status_id": null,
    "pictures": true,
    "pictures_urls": [
      "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dl1UftbX4AAF1Fj.jpg",
      "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dl1Um6OXsAAa1JS.jpg"
    ],
    "source": "<a href=\"http://twitter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter for Web</a>",
    "in_reply_to_screen_name": null,
    "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null,
    "retweeted": true,
    "retweet_count": 10,
    "like_count": 24,
    "place": null,
    "geolocated": false
  }
]
```

You can reduce this record's size by:

- Only indexing attributes that help build your search experience
- Reusing an attribute for different purposes. For example, `retweeted=false` is the same as `retweet_count=0`
- Adding attributes that rely on others. For example, if you want to use the `pictures` attribute to display a gallery (in the `pictures_url` array), only include it when the `pictures_urls` array isn't empty.

### After removing attributes

Choose only the information you need for searching, displaying, and ranking. Leave everything else out.

For example, after transforming the previous Twitter data, your record might look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Good morning #LaraconEU ! Swing by the Algolia booth for some vintage video games, awesome stickers, and lightning-fast search ðŸ˜Ž",
    "pictures_urls": [
      "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dl1UftbX4AAF1Fj.jpg",
      "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dl1Um6OXsAAa1JS.jpg"
    ],
    "retweet_count": 10,
    "like_count": 24
  }
]
```

Selecting only the necessary data reduces the number of attributes and record size without hurting search quality.
