If your source data has parent-child relationships between records and you want to maintain those relationships when you migrate to Algolia's JSON format, this guide outlines the recommended indexing process.

Use parent-child relationships when you want to:

- [Filter](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/) on children
- Update parents without affecting children
- Index a tree-like data structure
- Model a [one-to-many](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-many_(data_model)) relationship.

## Modeling the relationship in your JSON file

To model a parent-child relationship in [the records of your Algolia JSON data](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/#algolia-records):

- **Create one record per child**, and add a unique reference to their parent as a key-value pair (`parentID` in the example)
- **Don't create records for parents**.

### Dataset

```json
[
   {
      "parentID":"ABC",
      "parentName":"Parent",
      "name":"Child One"
   },
   {
      "parentID":"ABC",
      "parentName":"Parent",
      "name":"Child Two"
   }
]
```

## Implementation notes

Since:

- **You don't have any parent records:** you can only query children.
- **A parent may have many children:** use [Algolia's distinct feature](/guides/managing-results/refine-results/grouping/#introducing-algolias-distinct-feature) to retrieve the most relevant child per parent ( `parentID` in the preceding example).
