You can copy, or, duplicate whole indices, including records, settings, synonyms, and rules.
You can copy indices within an Algolia application in the dashboard and with the API.
If you want to [copy an index between two Algolia applications](#copy-indices-between-different-applications), you can use the API.

Copying an index [doesn't copy the associated analytics data](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/concepts/indices-analytics/).

<Callout type="info">
  Copying an index is resource-intensive and is
[rate-limited](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406975251089#when-do-we-trigger-the-rate-limit).
</Callout>

## Copy indices in the Algolia dashboard

Copying an index duplicates the records and configuration,
including synonyms and rules of an existing index (except the `enableReRanking` setting).

To copy or duplicate an index in the dashboard:

<Echo name="common/dashboard"/>

1. Select **Manage index > Duplicate**.

   <Media type="image" id="guides/indexing/copy-indices.png" alt="" />

1. Select **Create a new index** or **Overwrite an existing index** and enter the name of the destination index.

1. Enter `DUPLICATE` to confirm (if you're overwriting an existing index) and click **Duplicate**.

## Copy indices with the API

To copy indices, use one of these methods:

- API clients: [`copyIndex`](/api-reference/api-methods/copyIndex)
- Algolia CLI: [`algolia indices copy`](/tools/cli/commands/algolia-indices/#algolia-indices-copy)

By providing a [`scope`](/api-reference/api-methods/copyIndex/#method-param-scope) parameter or command-line option,
you can choose what you want to copy: records, settings, synonyms, or rules.

Copying an index has no impact on Analytics, because you can't copy an index's analytics data.
The **API keys** of the source are merged with the existing keys in the destination index.

### Copy indices fully

To copy an index **including records, settings, synonyms, and Rules**,
use the [`copyIndex`](/api-reference/api-methods/copyIndex) method without arguments:



If an index with the new name already exists, it's overwritten after the renaming.

<Callout type="warning">
  To prevent overwriting existing indices,
you can check if an index exists with the [`indexExists`](/api-reference/api-methods/indexExists) method.
</Callout>

If the source index doesn't exist, [`copyIndex`](/api-reference/api-methods/copyIndex) creates an empty index with zero records under the new name.
To prevent this, you can also use the [`indexExists`](/api-reference/api-methods/indexExists) method to see if the source index exists before copying.

### Copy indices partially

To copy **parts of an index**, you can use the [`scope`](/api-reference/api-methods/copyIndex/#method-param-scope) parameter.
For example, to copy only the synonyms and settings (but not records or Rules) between indices:



If you use the `scope` parameter, records aren't copied to the new index.
Existing items of the scope are replaced. Items belonging to other scopes are preserved.
For example, if you use the `settings` scope, only the settings are copied to the destination index,
keeping the records, synonyms, and Rules.

For more information, see [Scopes](/api-reference/api-methods/copy-index/#scopes).

### Indices with replicas

Copying a source index that has replicas copies the index's data, but not its replicas.
The destination index won't have replicas.

**You can't copy to a destination index that already has replicas.**

## Copy indices between different applications

To copy an index between different Algolia applications,
use the `AccountClient`, which is part of the [Algolia API clients](/api-client/getting-started/install/php/),
or use the Algolia CLI.

<div data-controller="language-specific-content" data-language="javascript">

For JavaScript, the `AccountClient` is distributed as a separate package `@algolia/client-account`.
You can install it from npm:

```sh
npm install @algolia/client-account
```

</div>



<Callout type="warning">
  If you copy an index to a different Algolia application,
the `targetIndex` **must not** exist, or the process fails.
</Callout>

If you want to _move_ an index between Algolia applications,
you can copy it first, and then [delete](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/how-to/delete-indices/) it.

## Copy index settings

If you want to copy only an index's setting to another index, you can use the
**Manage index > Copy Settings** action in the dashboard,
or the [`copySettings`](/api-reference/api-methods/copySettings) method of the API clients.
