To ease integration, Algolia built a set of libraries and tools to help you implement Algolia on your website or app.
To discover code samples and community-built integrations, visit the [Algolia Code Exchange](https://www.algolia.com/developers/code-exchange/)

## REST API

At the heart of Algolia's ecosystem is a [REST API](/api-reference/rest-api/).
While you can carry out any indexing, search, and configuration-related task with the REST API,
you should use an API client or another integration.

<Callout type="warning">
  You should only use the REST API to develop new API clients.
Using the REST API directly isn't covered by Algolia's [SLA](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla/) terms.
</Callout>

## Indexing and configuration

Algolia supports many programming languages and provides integrations for popular frameworks and ecommerce platforms.
These tools help you connect your data and configure Algolia.

### Algolia dashboard

In the [dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/dashboard/) you can configure most aspects of Algolia's products and features.

<div class="search-ignore">

### Algolia CLI

The [Algolia CLI](/tools/cli/) lets you interact with Algolia's APIs from your terminal, without code.

### API clients

Algolia's API clients provide convenient methods for interacting with Algolia's APIs,
and add additional features such as a retry strategy, or batching uploads.

### Framework integrations

Built on top of the API clients,
Algolia's framework integrations help synchronize your data between your database and Algolia.

### Ecommerce integrations

Algolia integrates with ecommerce platforms to help you index your product catalog and integrate Algolia
into your storefront UI.

## User interfaces

Algolia offers UI libraries with ready-to-use components that you can use as they are, or customize to suit your needs.

### UI design kit

If you want to design your next search and discovery experience,
you can use Algolia's [UI Design Kit (Figma)](/guides/building-search-ui/resources/ui-kit/js/).

### InstantSearch

[InstantSearch](/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/js/) is a family of UI libraries that let you build user interfaces for search and discovery from ready-made components (widgets). InstantSearch also gives you the tools to build your own widgets.
InstantSearch is available in different _flavors_ for JavaScript, React, Vue.js, Angular, iOS, and Android.



### Autocomplete

The Autocomplete UI library lets you build accessible, search-as-you-type user interfaces that you can integrate anywhere on your site or app.



### Recommend

The Recommend UI library lets you integrate recommendations from Algolia Recommend anywhere in your site. It's available for JavaScript and React.




## DocSearch



[DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) is the easiest way to add search to technical documentation and blogs.
DocSearch is free for technical documentation of open source projects and technical blogs.
Read [Who can apply?](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/who-can-apply/) for more information.

To get started, [apply](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply/) to the program and
[integrate DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/DocSearch-v3) into your website.

You can find examples of DocSearch for popular website builders, such as Docusaurus or VuePress,
in the [Code Exchange](https://www.algolia.com/developers/code-exchange/?refinementList%5Bproduct_features%5D%5B0%5D=Algolia%20Crawler).
