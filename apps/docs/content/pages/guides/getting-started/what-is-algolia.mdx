Your users almost certainly use at least one of YouTube, Amazon, and Facebook. An essential feature that these big websites share is great search. The reason they have great search is because they have hundreds or thousands of people working on it full-time.

Because your users are constantly exposed to great search on these platforms, they expect to find it on every site and app that they use. But your company isn't a search company: **it doesn't make sense for you to hire a dedicated team of developers to reinvent search.**

Algolia provides software and tools to help you implement **efficient, flexible, and insightful search on your sites and applications.**

## What does Algolia do?

Algolia consists of two parts: **search implementation** and **search analytics**. The implementation tools make it easier for your developers to create and maintain great search experiences for your users. The analytics tools enable your business teams to analyze the impact of those experiences and refine them, so they can directly address your evolving business objectives.

## Search as a feedback loop

Search has the potential to **not only help your business, but also shape it**.

To be clear, search doesn't _know_ the direction that your business should take. It _can_ help you **gather about what your users want, so you can better align your business with your users.**

Imagine having a way of asking every single user who walked into a physical store with all your products, "what are you looking for?" and recording their responses. This would give you a sense of what they're actually looking for, what they're not, and how both of these overlap with what you are currently providing.

**Algolia lets you immediately start collecting this information about your users.**


## What can Algolia do for my users?


Algolia provides your users with a fast and rich search experience. Your Algolia search interface can contain a search bar, filters, infinite scrolling, query suggestions, sorting, refinements, etc. These help your users **find what they're looking for** and **discover new products**.
