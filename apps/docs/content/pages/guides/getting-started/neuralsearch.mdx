NeuralSearch combines the precision of keyword search with the deep understanding of natural language and contextual relevance provided by AI-based [vector search](https://www.algolia.com/blog/ai/what-is-vector-search/).
On every keystroke, NeuralSearch performs a hybrid keyword and vector search,
merges the results, and ranks them based on relevance so that searchers get fast and accurate results that align with their search intent.

## Prerequisites for NeuralSearch

<Callout type="info">
  NeuralSearch is available on the [**Elevate**](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/) plan.
</Callout>

Before you can use NeuralSearch, you must:

- [Upload your data](/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/).
- [Send click and conversion events](/guides/sending-events/getting-started/) from your app or website to Algolia. NeuralSearch depends on user interactions to train the underlying language model for its vector search.

You need to collect at least 1,000 [`clickedObjectIDsAfterSearch`](/api-reference/api-methods/clicked-object-ids-after-search/) or 100 [`clickedObjectIDsAfterSearch`](/api-reference/api-methods/clicked-object-ids-after-search/) events within 30 days to activate NeuralSearch. If you have fewer events, you can’t use NeuralSearch.


## Set up NeuralSearch

You can activate NeuralSearch on an index in your Algolia dashboard:

<Echo name="common/dashboard"/>

1. Go to **Configure > NeuralSearch** and click **Configure NeuralSearch**.

1. Select your **event source**.
   By default, NeuralSearch uses events from the index you selected to train the language model.
   If your index has replicas, you can add them as additional event sources.
   Click **Add event sources** to add these additional event source indices.

1. If you collected enough events in the last 30 days, you can select one of these options:

   - Select **Activate NeuralSearch** to start the training and activate NeuralSearch for the current index.
   - Select **See NeuralSearch in action** to create a replica index where you can test NeuralSearch.

   Both options are inactive until you collect enough events.

<Callout type="info">
  Building the NeuralSearch index takes time, depending on your index size.
</Callout>

## Search with NeuralSearch

Searching with NeuralSearch works the same as before,
except with an increased understanding of the query.
Now, instead of matching only keywords in the text,
the search engine also returns results matching the _concept_ of what the searcher is looking for.

## Set the search mode in the API

After activating NeuralSearch in the dashboard,
you can use the [`mode`](/api-reference/api-parameters/mode) API parameter to turn NeuralSearch off:



To re-activate NeuralSearch for the current index:



## How NeuralSearch ranks results

NeuralSearch results have a neural score composed of a _keyword score_, a _semantic score_, or both.

### Keyword score

The keyword score represents how well a record matches the query from a keyword search against other keyword-retrieved results.
At the base of this score is Algolia's tie-breaking algorithm.
A record has a keyword score if keyword search finds it.

### Semantic score

The semantic score represents how well a record matches the query from a vector search against other vector-retrieved results.
At the basis of this score is [neural hash similarity](https://www.algolia.com/blog/ai/what-is-hashing-and-how-does-it-improve-website-and-app-search/).
A record has a semantic score if vector search finds it.

### Neural score

The neural score combines the keyword score and the semantic score.
It measures how relevant the record is compared to the other records in the result set.
The neural score answers the question:
_“Against this query, compared to these other results, how relevant is this result?”_
