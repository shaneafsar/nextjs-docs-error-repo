### Usage

`algolia search <index> [flags]`

### Examples

Search for objects in the "MOVIES" index matching the query "spiderman"

```sh command="algolia search MOVIES --query spiderman"
algolia search MOVIES --query spiderman
```

Search for objects in the "MOVIES" index matching the query "toy story" and filter the results by genre

```sh command="algolia search MOVIES --filters 'genre:Animation' --query 'toy story'"
algolia search MOVIES --filters 'genre:Animation' --query 'toy story'
```

Search for objects in the "MOVIES" index matching the query "spiderman" while setting the number of hits per page and specifying the page to retrieve

```sh command="algolia search MOVIES --query spiderman --hitsPerPage 2 --page 4"
algolia search MOVIES --query spiderman --hitsPerPage 2 --page 4
```

Search for objects in the "MOVIES" index matching the query "spiderman" and export the response to a .json file

```sh
algolia search MOVIES --query spiderman > movies.json
```

Search for objects in the "MOVIES" index matching the query "spiderman" and only export the results to a .json file

```sh
algolia search MOVIES --query spiderman --output='jsonpath={.Hits}' > movies.json
```
