Use the `algolia completion` command to set up [command completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion) for the Algolia CLI.
After you enabled command completion,
you can enter the first letters of a command and press the `Tab` key on your keyboard to see available commands and options.

Run `algolia completion <shell> --help` for more information about enabling command completion for the Algolia CLI for your shell.


## Setup for Homebrew

If you install the Algolia CLI with Homebrew and you set up [shell completion](https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion),
you don't need to configure anything extra.
Installing the Algolia CLI with Homebrew adds the completion functions to your environment.

## Setup for Bash

Command completion depends on the `bash-completion` package.
If it isn't installed already, you can install it with a package manager.
If you're using Homebrew, you can enter: `brew install bash-completion@2`.

To enable command completion for Bash **in the current session**, run:

```sh
source <(algolia completion bash)
```

To enable command completion for Bash **for every new session**, run:




<CodeSnippetGroup>

    
    ```sh
algolia completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/algolia
```

    
    ```sh
algolia completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/algolia
```

</CodeSnippetGroup>



Start a new Bash session to explore the completions.

## Setup for Zsh
