The Algolia CLI collects telemetry, such as the commands you use, your operating system, and your profile information.
For details, see [Which information is collected](#which-information-is-collected) on this page.

**The Algolia CLI doesn't collect sensitive information**, such as usernames, email addresses, or API keys.

You can opt out of telemetry collection any time.

## Opt out of telemetry for the current session

If you're on macOS or Linux,
you can turn off telemetry collection in your current session by setting the environment variable `ALGOLIA_CLI_TELEMETRY` to `0`.

For example, in Bash-like shells, run:

```bash
export ALGOLIA_CLI_TELEMETRY=0
```

If you start a new shell session, you need to repeat this command if you want to opt out again.

## Opt out of telemetry for all sessions

To turn off telemetry collection **for all sessions**,
run:




<CodeSnippetGroup>

    
    ```sh
setx ALGOLIA_CLI_TELEMETRY 0
refreshenv
```

    
    ```sh
echo "export ALGOLIA_CLI_TELEMETRY=0" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

    
    ```sh
echo "export ALGOLIA_CLI_TELEMETRY=0" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

</CodeSnippetGroup>
