## Disabling the plugin

You can temporarily turn off the plugin by adding the following environment variable in Netlify, under **Deploy > Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment**.

```yaml
ALGOLIA_DISABLED=true
```

## Uninstalling the plugin

To uninstall the plugin, go to your [Crawler Admin Console](https://crawler.algolia.com/admin/netlify) and click **Uninstall**. It automatically cleans up the environment variables and deletes associated data from Algolia.

You can also go to your [Netlify plugins](https://app.netlify.com/plugins) and click **Options > Uninstall plugin**.

<Callout type="info">
  This doesn't remove your data on Algolia, you can [manage your data on your Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/dashboard).
If you don't want to use Algolia anymore you can also [delete your Algolia account](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406981837457-How-do-I-delete-my-account-).
