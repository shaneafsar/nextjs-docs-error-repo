With the official Algolia plugin for Netlify, Algolia recommends to use this frontend bundle.
It's designed to be compatible with the index structure extracted by Algolia's [Netlify plugin](/tools/crawler/netlify-plugin/plugin).
It creates a new search input on your site with an autocomplete menu, providing search as you type results.

## Usage

## Using multiple branches

If you've set up the plugin to index multiple branches using the `branches` option, each configured branch has a dedicated index.
You also need to pass the information of which index you want to search in using the `branch` parameter of the integration.

To get access to the currently building branch, you can configure your build tool to forward the `HEAD` environment variable.
For instance, with [`webpack`'s environment plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/environment-plugin/) configured to forward `HEAD`, you would pass `branch: process.env.HEAD`.

If you've configured your plugin to index only specific branches, you need to duplicate the logic here so that it picks the correct branch only when appropriate.
For instance, with `branches = ['main', 'develop', 'feat/*']`, and using webpack's environment plugin to inject `HEAD`, here's how the snippet could look like:

```js
const currentBranch = process.env.HEAD; // Injected by your build tool
let targetBranch = 'main';
if (currentBranch === 'develop' || currentBranch.startsWith('feat/')) {
  targetBranch = currentBranch;
}
algoliasearchNetlify({
  // ...
  branch: targetBranch,
});
```

## Theme

You can theme the input and the autocomplete by using the `theme` property.

```js
// Example of dark theme:
{
  theme: {
    mark: '#fff',
    background: '#23263b',
    selected: '#111432',
    text: '#d6d6e7',
    colorSourceIcon: '#d6d6e7'
  }
}
```

To go further you should take a look at the [autocomplete.js documentation](/ui-libraries/autocomplete/introduction/what-is-autocomplete/), or implement your own search with [InstantSearch.js](/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/js/).
